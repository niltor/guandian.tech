[{"TitleEn":"Four models businesses like yours are using to monetize IoT","ContentEn":"<p><em>This post was co-authored by Peter Cooper, Senior Product Marketing Manager, Azure IoT and Mark Pendergrast, Director of Product Marketing, Microsoft Azure.</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>It&rsquo;s easy to talk about all the cool things your company might do to leverage the Internet of Things (IoT). Figuring out how you&rsquo;re actually going to make them work for your business is a bit more challenging &mdash; particularly the part about how to monetize them.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>IoT technologies have major potential to open new revenue streams. Capitalizing on them often requires out-of-the-box thinking and a willingness to take smart risks.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"https://azurecomcdn.azureedge.net/mediahandler/acomblog/media/Default/blog/a844ea9f-3e66-4cbd-9ee5-18cbf5f211bb.jpg\"><img alt=\"Prepare your Organization\" border=\"0\" height=\"540\" src=\"https://azurecomcdn.azureedge.net/mediahandler/acomblog/media/Default/blog/9cfaa36c-b018-4c6b-aba6-296b20e32061.jpg\" style=\"margin: 0px auto; border: 0px currentcolor; border-image: none; float: none; display: block; background-image: none;\" title=\"Hero_IoT_Prepare your Org\" width=\"960\"></a></p>\r\n\r\n<p>We&rsquo;ve helped thousands of customers around the world profit from IoT. Over the course of these engagements, we&rsquo;ve found that their monetization models tend to fall into four categories. Here are some options to consider as you build your approach &mdash; take a look:</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>1. The one-and-done: one-time purchasing</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>A one-time purchase is a common model. IoT connectivity is added as a feature, allowing products to be sold at a premium or to stand out from the competition. This approach works great for scenarios where repeating, revenue-generating services are not required, and your products don&rsquo;t need ongoing support. For example, many <a href=\"https://customers.microsoft.com/en-us/story/askey\" target=\"_blank\">wearable devices</a> and <a href=\"https://customers.microsoft.com/en-us/story/legrand-manufacturing-azure\" target=\"_blank\">connected home products</a> are sold this way. Once the transaction is done, the customer owns the device outright.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>That&rsquo;s not the end of the story, however. The data you collect from these products can be extremely valuable. You can use it to improve products over time, get more bang for your marketing buck, and spot growth opportunities before your competitors do.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This is the easiest pricing model for manufacturers to adopt because it&rsquo;s how things are generally sold today. The trick to making this model work is ensuring that continuing costs associated with connected products don&rsquo;t erode your profits over time. For example, if you&rsquo;re collecting and storing data or providing a dashboard to customers, these functions must be factored in.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>2. Good, better, best: value-added product services</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Keeping the revenue flowing after the product has been sold is a major growth opportunity for manufacturers. With connected products, you can offer subscriptions for value-added services. <a href=\"https://customers.microsoft.com/en-gb/story/buhlergroup-azure-machine-learning-iot-edge-switzerland\" target=\"_blank\">Food processing equipment leader Buhler</a>, for example, is using a subscription-based model for its grain-sorting machines, charging based on which features customers enable.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In addition to boosting profits, subscriptions help you stay close to customers throughout the product lifecycle, not just when things break. Services can include anything from rich data and operational reporting to predictive maintenance alerts. Many companies take a tiered approach, offering a freemium option and charging for more advanced solutions. It&rsquo;s a great way to crack open a new market &mdash; give customers a taste of the value of connected products and they&rsquo;ll soon want more.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The subscription service model does depart significantly from the single-transaction approach, though. Persuading buyers to pay an ongoing premium requires you to present a clear value proposition and provide strong customer support. Customers will expect regular improvements and a robust, reliable experience.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>3. Pay-as-you-go: turning products into services</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>IoT is overturning the traditional ownership experience, allowing customers to pay only for what they use. Product-as-a-service models are familiar to anyone who has used a bike- or car-sharing service, where vehicles are tracked by GPS and rented by the hour or minute. The buyer avoids capital and maintenance expenses and always has the latest technology, while the vendor gets an ongoing revenue stream that can provide more profit and stability over the long term.<br>\r\n&nbsp;<br>\r\nThis model can work even for very complex and expensive products. For example, <a href=\"https://customers.microsoft.com/en-us/story/rollsroycestory\" target=\"_blank\">Rolls-Royce now sells flight hours instead of airplane engines</a>. Data collected from IoT sensors lets the company know exactly how long the engines have been used &mdash; and gives it the data it needs to keep them in top condition. Using advanced analytics, the company can predict and resolve mechanical issues before something breaks.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>4. We&rsquo;re in this together: revenue-sharing</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Confident your IoT solution will deliver improved results to customers? Consider a revenue-sharing model. Instead of selling products or services, you&rsquo;ll be selling outcomes. In fact, another name for this approach is &ldquo;outcomes as a service.&rdquo; <a href=\"https://cloudblogs.microsoft.com/industry-blog/industry/uncategorized/itron-creating-a-more-resourceful-world-through-digital-transformation/\" target=\"_blank\">One example is Itron</a>, whose Total Outcomes service provides IoT services to cities, charging customers based on cost savings and performance targets. Because it requires your company to take on some of the business risk, this model can be very attractive to customers. It&rsquo;s also the furthest from traditional manufacturing revenue models, and likely to require the most innovative thinking and pricing strategies.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Which model is right for your business?</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Plan to invest some time and resources to figure out how you&rsquo;ll monetize IoT. Successful initiatives often start with a pilot project involving a few good customers. Beyond the IoT solution itself, systems, people, and processes will need to adapt to new ways of doing business.

However, over time, the factory software (“firmware”) must be updated to support new features or fix issues.</p>\n<p>Firmware updates for embedded components have three primary delivery mechanisms:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Stand-alone tools</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-hardware/drivers/bringup/windows-uefi-firmware-update-platform\">Windows UEFI UpdateCapsule</a> drivers</li>\n<li>Component-specific firmware update drivers</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Each of those mechanisms have its own advantages. Stand-alone tools can support component-specific protocols but require the user to find and download the tools and find out if an update is available and applicable. UEFI UpdateCapsule drivers can be pushed through Windows Update but can only update components during boot-time when components may not be available or may not be attached. The most flexible mechanism is the component-specific firmware update driver, which can support component-specific protocols and can run whenever the device is enumerated on the system.</p>\n<p>Writing a firmware update driver for each component-specific protocol can become a burden, so we defined the Component Firmware Update (CFU) standard protocol for use in our firmware update drivers and components. The protocol permits us to use a standardized driver and protocol to deliver firmware to any component that supports CFU.</p>\n<p>Due to architectural differences, third-party firmware, or other issues, many of our components cannot support CFU. We designed CFU to allow a CFU-compatible component to receive firmware by using the CFU protocol and forward it to other components using their specific protocols. Thus, only one component in a collection of components needs to be CFU-compatible. The CFU driver delivers sub-component firmware to the primary component for forwarding to non-CFU components.</p>\n<p>For components with very limited battery power, such as small wireless peripherals, firmware downloads are expensive operations and waste significant battery life if the firmware is ultimately rejected by the peripheral. To avoid this, CFU “offers” a firmware image before it is downloaded, providing specific properties such as version, hardware platform, and so on. If the primary component accepts an offer, it may still reject the firmware after download due to integrity issues that may arise during the transport of the image, or if the received image properties do not match the offered properties.</p>\n<p>As part of our open-source effort, we are sharing the CFU protocol, driver sample, firmware sample code, and tool sample. This aims at enabling the system and peripheral developers to leverage this protocol, support their development, easily and automatically push firmware updates to Windows Update for many of their firmware components.</p>\n<h1>Goals and Non-Goals</h1>\n<p>CFU was developed with the following tenets in mind:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Update must occur with little or no user disruption – no “update mode” that requires the user to wait or even be aware that an update is taking place.</li>\n<li>Update must be delivered through Windows Update drivers.</li>\n<li>Update must be able to wait to update a device until it becomes available.</li>\n<li>Drivers must not have to “know” specifics of any update package other than which component device to send it to.</li>\n<li>Evaluation of the appropriateness of the update lies with the component receiving it, not in the driver.</li>\n<li>Target must be able to reject firmware before it is downloaded if it is inappropriate.</li>\n<li>Update must permit third-party versioning schemes to be mapped to a standardized versioning scheme.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>CFU permits but does not specify:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Authentication policies or methods</li>\n<li>Encryption policies or methods</li>\n<li>Rollback policies or methods</li>\n<li>Recovery of bricked firmware</li>\n</ul>\n<h1>System Overview</h1>\n<p>In CFU, a <em>primary</em> <em>component</em> is a device that understands the CFU protocol. This component can receive firmware from a CFU driver for itself or for the <em>sub-components</em> to which the component is connected. The CFU driver (<em>host</em>) is created by the component or device manufacturer and delivered through Windows Update. The driver is installed and loaded when the device is detected by Windows.</p>\n<h2>Primary Components and Sub-Components</h2>\n<p>A CFU-compatible system uses a hierarchical concept of a primary component and sub-components.  A primary component is a device that implements the device side of the CFU protocol and can receive updates for itself or its sub-components directly from the CFU driver. A primary component and sub-components can be internal or detachable.  A device may have multiple primary components, with or without sub-components, each with its own CFU driver.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://blogs.windows.com/uploads/mswbprod/sites/3/2018/10/2df6976225cb82a255bb26a23424ef1d.png\"><img class=\"wp-image-54465 size-full aligncenter\" src=\"https://blogs.windows.com/uploads/mswbprod/sites/3/2018/10/2df6976225cb82a255bb26a23424ef1d.png\" alt=\"Flow chart describing CFU Driver.\" width=\"939\" height=\"543\" srcset=\"https://blogs.windows.com/uploads/mswbprod/sites/3/2018/10/2df6976225cb82a255bb26a23424ef1d.png 939w, https://blogs.windows.com/uploads/mswbprod/sites/3/2018/10/2df6976225cb82a255bb26a23424ef1d-300x173.png 300w, https://blogs.windows.com/uploads/mswbprod/sites/3/2018/10/2df6976225cb82a255bb26a23424ef1d-768x444.png 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 939px) 100vw, 939px\" /></a></p>\n<p>Sub-components are updated by the component after receiving a CFU firmware image that is targeted for the sub-component. The mechanism that the component uses to update its sub-components is implementation specific between the sub-component and the primary component and is beyond the scope of the CFU specification.</p>\n<h2>Offers and Payloads</h2>\n<p>A CFU driver (host) may contain multiple firmware images for a primary component and sub-components associated with the component.<a href=\"https://blogs.windows.com/uploads/mswbprod/sites/3/2018/10/76445fa42446188a590161a74af65f61.png\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-54468\" src=\"https://blogs.windows.com/uploads/mswbprod/sites/3/2018/10/76445fa42446188a590161a74af65f61.png\" alt=\"Chart showing firmware images.\" width=\"974\" height=\"479\" srcset=\"https://blogs.windows.com/uploads/mswbprod/sites/3/2018/10/76445fa42446188a590161a74af65f61.png 974w, https://blogs.windows.com/uploads/mswbprod/sites/3/2018/10/76445fa42446188a590161a74af65f61-300x148.png 300w, https://blogs.windows.com/uploads/mswbprod/sites/3/2018/10/76445fa42446188a590161a74af65f61-768x378.png 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 974px) 100vw, 974px\" /></a></p>\n<p>A package within the host comprises an <em>offer</em> and a <em>payload</em> or image and other information necessary for the driver to load. The offer contains enough information about the payload to allow the primary component to decide if it is an acceptable payload.  Offer information includes a CFU protocol version, component ID (and sub-component ID if applicable), firmware version, release vs. debug status, and other information. For some devices, downloading and flashing new firmware is expensive for battery life and other reasons. By issuing an offer, the CFU protocol avoids downloading or flashing firmware that would be rejected based on versioning and other platform policies.</p>\n<p>The payload of a package is a range of addresses and bytes to be programmed. The bytes are opaque to the host.</p>\n<h2>Offer Sequence</h2>\n<p>The general firmware update sequence by using CFU is for the host to issue the offer of each package to the primary component. In general, the primary component can accept, reject, or skip the offer.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Accept offer—The primary component is ready to accept the firmware that was offered. If an offer is accepted, the payload is immediately delivered to the primary component.</li>\n<li>Reject offer—The primary component is not interested in the firmware, possibly because it already has a better firmware, or the firmware violates some other internal policy.</li>\n<li>Skip offer—The primary component may be interested in the firmware, but it is choosing to skip it for now.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>If the offer is rejected or skipped, the host continues to cycle through its list of offers.  The driver repeats this cycle until all offers are rejected.</p>\n<p>The optional skip response permits the primary component to examine the entire offer list to arrange it for ordering dependencies according to internal policies. After it has prioritized the offers in the list, it can continue to skip and accept the highest priority offer when the host replays the sequence. After an offer has been accepted and installed it is subsequently rejected if offered in a later cycle because the entity is up to date.  The cycle ends when all offers have been rejected. Because updates can change the policies themselves, such as “jail-breaking” during development, all offers are issued every cycle, even those that were previously rejected.</p>\n<p>An offer can also be rejected if the primary component has accepted a download but must be restarted. In this case the component can reboot itself, if the user disruption is minimal, or the update can remain pending until the next system reboot.

It ends the update process and updates its status in <strong>Device Manager</strong> according to the update results.</p>\n<p>So, this mechanism permits ordering of updates, even to the same entity.  For example, if a component cannot receive version Y until it has version X due to some breaking change, both versions could be included, and version Y could be skipped until version X has been applied.</p>\n<h2>CFU Driver (host) Independence</h2>\n<p>It is important to note that the host does not have to make any decisions based on content of the offers or payloads. It simply sends the offers down and sends down the payloads that are accepted. It does not have to have any logic about what it is offering.  This permits it to be reused for diverse components and sub-components by changing only the offers and payloads it contains, and the component that the driver loads on.</p>\n<p>The host does know the standard format of the offers to send the offer command. The host needs to understand the standard format of the payloads so that it can break them into addresses and bytes to deliver to the primary component. In the payload, the host does not need to know what data those fields contain.</p>\n<h2>Payload Delivery</h2>\n<p>After an offer has been accepted, the CFU Driver (the host) proceeds to download the firmware image, or Payload.  The primary component may prepare itself to receive it upon accepting the offer, or it may wait for the download to commence before making any changes.  The primary component may optionally cache the offer to check it against the payload after the payload is delivered but if possible, must evaluate the payload on its own merit, regardless of the offer.</p>\n<p>Payload Delivery is accomplished in three phases, essentially, beginning, middle and end.</p>\n<p>The Payload, in simplest terms, is a set of addresses and fixed-size arrays of bytes, for example Address 0x0000 0000 and 16 associated bytes, then Address 0x0000 0010 and 16 more bytes.  These are turned into write requests, one per address in the set, with its associated bytes.</p>\n<p>The first write request is flagged so that the Component can do any preparations that it did not do when the Offer was first accepted, such as erase memory.  After the first write request, the Driver sends more Address + Data write commands until the final write.  The final write is flagged such that the Component knows that the download is complete and that it should validate the download and invoke or forward the new firmware.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://blogs.windows.com/uploads/mswbprod/sites/3/2018/10/133b0ff2c3a8a99b8fdd04046878ff9f.png\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-54489\" src=\"https://blogs.windows.com/uploads/mswbprod/sites/3/2018/10/133b0ff2c3a8a99b8fdd04046878ff9f.png\" alt=\"Chart showing download.\" width=\"441\" height=\"849\" srcset=\"https://blogs.windows.com/uploads/mswbprod/sites/3/2018/10/133b0ff2c3a8a99b8fdd04046878ff9f.png 441w, https://blogs.windows.com/uploads/mswbprod/sites/3/2018/10/133b0ff2c3a8a99b8fdd04046878ff9f-156x300.png 156w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 441px) 100vw, 441px\" /></a></p>\n<p>The CFU Protocol specification defines several other result codes to assist in troubleshooting failures. See the complete specification for details. There is also room for implementers to add other codes for their own specific purposes, such as requesting immediate resets.</p>\n<h2>Payload Validation and Authentication</h2>\n<p>One of the most important aspects of firmware update is the validation of incoming firmware.  The first line of defense is to use a reliable transport mechanism with built-in robustness, such as USB or Bluetooth. These transports have built-in CRCs and retry mechanisms so that data is delivered reliably and in order.  Interfaces such as I<sup>2</sup>C<img src=\"https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/11/72x72/2122.png\" alt=\"™\" class=\"wp-smiley\" style=\"height: 1em; max-height: 1em;\" />, SPI and UART do not have those mechanisms built-in and such robustness must be provided by higher layers.  At Microsoft, we prefer to use USB or Bluetooth Human Interface Device Class (HID) protocols for CFU, with a Vendor-Specific report structure, but any bidirectional command-response based mechanism can be used.</p>\n<p>At a minimum, the primary component should verify bytes after each write to ensure that the data is properly stored before accepting the next set of bytes. Also, a CRC or hash should be calculated on the download in its entirety to be verified after the download is complete, to ensure that the data was not modified in transit. The delivery of a reference CRC or hash to be validated is beyond the scope of the protocol but is typically contained within the download image itself and verified by the primary component or sub-component that receives it before issuing a Result Code.</p>\n<p>For enhanced protection, a cryptographic signature mechanism is recommended to provide end-to-end protection against accidental modification or intentional attack at any stage in the update delivery, from creation at the manufacturer to invocation by the component. If the download is required be confidential, an encryption mechanism can also be employed. Decryption and key management is also beyond of scope of the CFU protocol specification.</p>\n<p>After the image has been authenticated, its properties should be validated against the offer and any other internal rules that the manufacturer requires. CFU does not specify the rules to be applied &#8212; these are up to the implementer. It is important to do this check <em>after </em>the update has been authenticated so that any self-declared characteristics can be considered trustworthy.</p>\n<p>While it is possible (and recommended) for each sub-Component to validate its own images, one advantage of CFU is that the primary component can accept offers and validate the sub-component image on behalf of the sub-component by using a standardized validation algorithm devised by the manufacturer. The manufacturer can then design the primary component to apply the firmware by using less-secure means such as ARM-SWD, JTAG or other hardware-based methods.</p>\n<h2>Payload Invocation</h2>\n<p>One of the advantages of the CFU Protocol is that it is run at the application level in the primary component. It is not necessary to place the component in any special mode that disrupts its normal operation. As long as the component can receive and store the incoming payload without significant disruption, it can continue to do other tasks. The only potential disruption comes when the new firmware must be invoked.</p>\n<p>There are two recommended means to avoid that disruption, although others are possible.  Both involve having enough storage to maintain the current running application while receiving at least one additional image. For the primary component, this means that it requires at least twice the normal application space, one space for the running primary component application, and one space for the incoming firmware package. For sub-components whose images are smaller than the primary component image, the primary component can use the extra space to store the sub-component image in its entirety.  If the sub-component image is larger than the primary component firmware, then separate packages are necessary, and must all be downloaded successfully for the sub-component update to complete.</p>\n<p>The first invocation method uses a small bootloader image to select one of multiple images to run when the device is reset, typically at boot time, connection or power-up. The image selection algorithm is implementation specific, but typically is based on an algorithm involving the version of code, and an indication of successful validation of that image either at boot or when it was received. This is the most generic approach.</p>\n<p>A second invocation method is to physically swap the memory of the desired image into the active address space upon reset. This capability is available in some microcontrollers and can also be accomplished with logic controls on external memory address bits.  This method has a disadvantage in that it requires specialized hardware but has the advantage that all images are statically linked to the same address space, and the mechanism does not require any bootloader.</p>\n<h1>CFU Protocol Limitations</h1>\n<p>There are a few caveats around CFU.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>CFU cannot update a “bricked” component that can no longer run the protocol, yet new firmware has the potential to brick the component if not thoroughly validated and tested.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><em>Care must be taken when adopting any update mechanism to always test the update mechanism prior to every release.</em></p>\n<p>At Microsoft, we always build a “v.next” version so that we can validate that CFU has not been broken and can validate and invoke any subsequent update properly. Unbricking the component is beyond the of scope for the CFU protocol because the device cannot run the CFU protocol.</p>\n<p>Implementers can use other methods to prevent bricking a device, such as having a third “fallback” fail-safe firmware image that is capable of CFU but that may not provide some features, or by implementing CFU as a function of the bootloader that is called by the application. If the application fails, the bootloader can be forced to take over and either fall back or provide a ‘bare-bones’ CFU interface until it is successfully updated.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>CFU does not provide security. Security features can easily be overlaid on top of CFU by adding features to the validation algorithms used by the component and adding necessary data structures to the downloaded images such as Public Key Digital Signatures and appropriate key management.</li>\n<li>CFU requires extra memory to store the incoming images because the protocol runs as part current firmware on the primary component. This will add cost to a system for the benefit of non-disruptive updates to the system.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Updating sub-component images that are larger than the component’s available storage requires dividing the sub-component image into a set of smaller update packages called <em>segments </em>and applying each segment separately.</p>\n<p>The CFU protocol does not prohibit pausing the download to while portions of the image are forwarded. Thus, it may be possible to stream a large image through the primary component without segmentation. Such “streamed” segmentation is beyond the scope of the CFU specification. Care must be taken that the image can be properly validated after such a download is complete, such as maintenance of a running CRC or hash, as it is not fully resident in the primary component at the end of the download.</p>\n<p>CFU presumes that the primary component has a set of validation rules to use. If those rules are to be changed, the component must first be successfully updated by using the old rules before new rules can be applied.</p>\n<p>There is example source code for the Host CFU drivers and Firmware along with documentation on GitHub.  <strong><a href=\"https://github.com/Microsoft/CFU\">Component Firmware Update.</a></strong></p>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://blogs.windows.com/buildingapps/2018/10/17/introducing-component-firmware-update/\">Introducing Component Firmware Update</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://blogs.windows.com/buildingapps\">Windows Developer Blog</a>.</p>\n","Link":"https://blogs.windows.com/buildingapps/2018/10/17/introducing-component-firmware-update/","Categories":"BlogRss","IsPublishMP":false,"Thumbnail":"","Title":null,"AuthorName":"Microsoft Devices Team","Author":null,"Comments":null,"ViewNunmber":0,"Content":null,"Keywords":"","Summary":null,"Id":"5e5cf3ae-3fc7-4a0f-8dc6-a8bb26a91fd0","CreatedTime":"2018-10-18T07:02:02+08:00","UpdatedTime":"2018-11-05T14:09:46.0961239+08:00","Status":0},{"TitleEn":"The top 6 ways to boost ratings, reviews, and feedback for your app","ContentEn":"<p>A frequent question we get from developers is, “How can I encourage customers to review and give feedback on my app?”</p>\n<p>User feedback isn’t just useful for product development—it can significantly affect whether a new customer decides to download your product.

Hotspot functions were only available at the assembly-level and not at source-level, as shown in the figure below.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://msdnshared.blob.core.windows.net/media/2018/10/hotspot1.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"882\" height=\"748\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-19735\" /></p>\n<p>VTune Amplifier 2019 addresses this issue and provides full source code analysis for JIT compiled code on both Windows and Linux. It also supports remote profiling a Linux target from a Windows host. Let’s see how these features work using sample .NET Core applications on local Linux host, local Windows host and remote Linux profiling with Windows host analysis.</p>\n<p>Here is the hardware/software configuration for the test system:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Processor: Intel(R) Core(TM) i7-5960X CPU @ 3.00GHz</li>\n<li>Memory: 32 GB</li>\n<li>Ubuntu* 16.04 LTS (64-bit)</li>\n<li>Microsoft Windows 10 Pro Version 1803 (64-bit)</li>\n<li>.NET Core SDK 2.1.401</li>\n</ul>\n<h1>Profiling .NET Core applications on a local Linux host</h1>\n<p>Let’s create a sample .NET Core application on Linux that multiplies two matrices using the code available <span><a href=\"https://gist.github.com/vkvenkat/f4beadb3fb178a70010002d7753980b2\">here</a></span>. Following is the C# source code snippet of interest:</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://msdnshared.blob.core.windows.net/media/2018/10/sample1.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"617\" height=\"350\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-19745\" /></p>\n<p>Now let’s refer to the instructions from our earlier <span><a href=\"https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/dotnet/2017/10/23/net-core-performance-profiling-with-intel-vtune-amplifier-2018/\">.NET blog</a></span> to build and run this application using the .NET Core command-line interface (CLI). Next let’s use VTune Amplifier to profile this application using the Launch Application target type and the Hardware Event-Based Sampling mode as detailed in the following picture.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://msdnshared.blob.core.windows.net/media/2018/10/launch_application.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"1000\" height=\"729\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-19755\" /></p>\n<p>Here are the hotspots under the Process/Module/Function/Thread/Call Stack grouping:</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://msdnshared.blob.core.windows.net/media/2018/10/hotspot2.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"764\" height=\"261\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-19765\" /></p>\n<p>Now let’s take a look at the source-level hotspots for the Program::Multiply function, which is a major contributor to overall CPU time.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://msdnshared.blob.core.windows.net/media/2018/10/hotspot3.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"961\" height=\"683\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-19775\" /></p>\n<p>The above figure shows that most of the time is being spent in line 62 which performs matrix arithmetic operations. This source-assembly mapping helps both .NET Core application and compiler developers to identify their source-level hotspots and determine optimization opportunities.</p>\n<p>Now, let’s use the new source code analysis feature to examine the assembly snippets corresponding to the highlighted source line.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://msdnshared.blob.core.windows.net/media/2018/10/hotspot4.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"1008\" height=\"784\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-19785\" /></p>\n<p>From the above profile, it is clear that reducing the time spent in matrix arithmetic operations would help lower overall application time. One of the possible optimizations here would be to replace the rectangular array data structure used to represent individual matrices with jagged arrays. The C# source code snippet below shows how to do this (complete code is available <span><a href=\"https://gist.github.com/vkvenkat/f35b8ff9552e33c6a11453bcea7d25fa\">here</a></span>).</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://msdnshared.blob.core.windows.net/media/2018/10/sample2.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"632\" height=\"354\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-19795\" /></p>\n<p>Here is the updated list of hotspot functions from VTune Amplifier:</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://msdnshared.blob.core.windows.net/media/2018/10/hotspot5.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"782\" height=\"243\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-19805\" /></p>\n<p>We can see that the overall application time has reduced by about 21%<sup>1</sup> (from 16.660 s to 13.175 s).</p>\n<p>The following figure shows the source-assembly mapping for the Program::Multiply function. We see that there is a corresponding reduction in CPU time for the highlighted source line which performs matrix arithmetic operations. Note that the size of the JIT generated code has been reduced too.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://msdnshared.blob.core.windows.net/media/2018/10/hotspot6.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"1002\" height=\"718\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-19815\" /></p>\n<p>This is a brief description about the feature on Linux. Similar analysis with the matrix multiplication samples above could be done on Windows and we leave that as an exercise for you to try. Now, let’s use a different example to see how source code analysis works on Windows.</p>\n<h1>Profiling .NET Core applications on a local Windows host</h1>\n<p>Let’s create a sample .NET Core application on Windows that reverses an integer array using the code available <span><a href=\"https://gist.github.com/vkvenkat/960b9c4704f8e63066833bb4c6e65db8\">here</a></span>.

Next let’s use VTune Amplifier to profile this application using the Launch Application target type and the Hardware Event-Based Sampling mode as detailed in the following picture. Additionally, we need to provide the source file location on Windows using the Search Sources/Binaries button before profiling.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://msdnshared.blob.core.windows.net/media/2018/10/hotspot7.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"977\" height=\"709\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-19835\" /></p>\n<p>Here are the hotspots under the Process/Module/Function/Thread/Call Stack grouping:</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://msdnshared.blob.core.windows.net/media/2018/10/hotspot8.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"797\" height=\"245\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-19845\" /></p>\n<p>Now let’s take a look at the source-level hotspots for the Program::IterativeReverse function, which is a major contributor to overall CPU time.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://msdnshared.blob.core.windows.net/media/2018/10/hotspot9.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"908\" height=\"935\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-19855\" /></p>\n<p>The above figure shows that most of the time is being spent in line 48 which performs array element re-assignment. Now, let’s use the new source code analysis feature to examine the assembly snippets corresponding to the highlighted source line.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://msdnshared.blob.core.windows.net/media/2018/10/hotspot10.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"1093\" height=\"933\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-19865\" /></p>\n<p>One of the possible optimizations here would be to reverse the integer array by using recursion, rather than iterating over the array contents. The C# source code snippet below shows how to do this (complete code is available <span><a href=\"https://gist.github.com/vkvenkat/02a7541e095b1cc5775f88ce9f69e931\">here</a></span>).</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://msdnshared.blob.core.windows.net/media/2018/10/sample4.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"592\" height=\"277\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-19875\" /></p>\n<p>Here is the updated list of hotspot functions from VTune Amplifier:</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://msdnshared.blob.core.windows.net/media/2018/10/hotspot11.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"801\" height=\"244\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-19885\" /></p>\n<p>We can see that the overall application time has reduced by about 42%<sup>2</sup> (from 13.095 s to 7.600 s).</p>\n<p>The following figure shows the source-assembly mapping for the Program::RecursiveReverse function.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://msdnshared.blob.core.windows.net/media/2018/10/hotspot151.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"1056\" height=\"933\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-19955\" /></p>\n<p>As we can see, the reduction in time is reflected in the source lines above, giving developers a clear picture on how their application performs.</p>\n<h1>Profiling .NET Core applications on a remote Linux target and analyzing the results on a Windows host</h1>\n<p>Sometimes .NET Core developers may need to collect performance data on remote target systems and later finalize the data on a different machine in order to work around resource constraints on the target system or to reduce overhead when finalizing the collected data. VTune Amplifier 2019 has added .NET Core support to collect profiling data from a remote Linux target system and analyze the results on a Windows host system. This section illustrates how to leverage this capability using the matrix multiplication .NET Core application discussed earlier (source code is available <span><a href=\"https://gist.github.com/vkvenkat/f4beadb3fb178a70010002d7753980b2\">here</a></span>).</p>\n<p>First let’s publish the sample application for an x64 target type on either the host or the target with: dotnet publish –c Release –r linux-x64. Then we need to copy the entire folder with sources and binaries to the other machine. Next let’s setup a password-less SSH access to the target with PuTTY, using instructions <span><a href=\"https://software.intel.com/en-us/vtune-amplifier-help-configuring-ssh-access-for-remote-collection\">here</a></span>. We also need to set /proc/sys/kernel/perf_event_paranoid and /proc/sys/kernel/kptr_restrict to 0 in the target system to enable driverless profiling so that user does not need to install target packages, while VTune Amplifier automatically installs the appropriate collectors on the target system.</p>\n<p>echo 0 | sudo tee /proc/sys/kernel/perf_event_paranoid</p>\n<p>echo 0 | sudo tee /proc/sys/kernel/kptr_restrict</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Now let’s use VTune Amplifier on the host machine to start remote profiling the application run on the target. First we need to set the profiling target to Remote Linux (SSH) and provide the necessary details to establish an SSH connection with the target. VTune Amplifier automatically installs the appropriate collectors on the target system in the /tmp/vtune_amplifier_&lt;version&gt;.&lt;package_num&gt; directory.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://msdnshared.blob.core.windows.net/media/2018/10/config.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"350\" height=\"104\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-19905\" /></p>\n<p>Then let’s select the Launch Application target type and the Hardware Event-Based Sampling modes. Additionally, we need to provide the binary and source file locations on Windows using the Search Sources/Binaries button before profiling.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://msdnshared.blob.core.windows.net/media/2018/10/config_analysis.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"955\" height=\"876\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-19915\" /></p>\n<p>Here are the hotspots under the Process/Module/Function/Thread/Call Stack grouping:</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://msdnshared.blob.core.windows.net/media/2018/10/hotspot13.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"789\" height=\"286\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-19925\" /></p>\n<p>Let’s look at source code analysis in action by selecting one of the hotspot functions.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://msdnshared.blob.core.windows.net/media/2018/10/hotspot14.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"1159\" height=\"732\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-19935\" /></p>\n<p>The support for remote profiling would enable developers collect low-overhead profiling data on resource-constrained target platforms and then analyze this information on the host.</p>\n<h1><strong>Summary</strong></h1>\n<p>The Source Code Analysis feature can be a useful value addition to the .NET Core community, especially for developers interested in performance optimization as they can get insights into hotspots at the source code and assembly levels and then work on targeted optimizations. We continue to look for additional .NET Core scenarios that could benefit from feature enhancements of VTune Amplifier.

When it comes to managing your project in Azure DevOps (formerly VSTS) or GitHub, you have all of your artifacts in one place: code, CI/CD pipelines, releases, work items, and more. In cases where there’s a larger project with a larger team, the rate at which pull requests and work items are created, opened, and closed will increase significantly between each release. Imagine a large user base that wanted to stay updated on these changes and updates through release notes. They’ll want to know if that pesky bug that was introduced in the last version got fixed this time, or if that feature they’re excited about finally made it out of beta.</p>\n<p>Release notes tend to map directly to items that a team is tracking internally; I’d expect a work item on a bug high severity to make it into the release documentation. However, putting together release notes can be quite a challenge and very time consuming. When it’s time to ship new software updates, someone must manually go back in time to the last release, gather the relevant information, and compile it into a document to share with users. How do we keep the release information current and accurate for end users?</p>\n<p>It’d be nice to automate the process of extracting information from completed work items and merged pull requests to create a document that outlines changes in a new release. This was the inspiration of the Release Notes Generator. With Azure Functions and Azure Blob Storage, the generator creates a markdown file every time a new release is created in Azure DevOps. In this post, we’ll walk through how the generator works, and use a sample DevOps project as an example for the generator. If you’d like a GitHub version, see the <span><a href=\"https://open.microsoft.com/2018/09/06/how-to-automate-software-release-notes/?WT.mc_id=dotnet-blog-jasmineg\">GitHub release notes generator sister post</a></span>.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://msdnshared.blob.core.windows.net/media/2018/10/adoworkitems.png\"><img src=\"https://msdnshared.blob.core.windows.net/media/2018/10/adoworkitems-e1539638432651.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-19615 size-full\" width=\"800\" height=\"379\" /></a></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center\"><em>Overview of an Azure DevOps Project’s Work Items</em></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://msdnshared.blob.core.windows.net/media/2018/10/renderedmkd.png\"><img src=\"https://msdnshared.blob.core.windows.net/media/2018/10/renderedmkd-e1539638493118.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-19605 size-full\" width=\"800\" height=\"377\" /></a></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center\"><em>View of Rendered Markdown version of release notes in VS Code with <a href=\"https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=yzhang.markdown-all-in-one\">Markdown All in One Extension</a></em></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The generator is an Azure Function app; Functions allow you to only pay for the time your code is running, so I’m only paying for the time it takes my code that generates notes to execute. With an HTTP triggered function, a webhook is configured in Azure DevOps to send an HTTP request to the function to kick off the notes generation process. Webhook configuration simply requires you to copy the url of the function that you’d like to send the endpoint to. An added benefit of using Azure Functions is that you can get started locally on your machine using <span><a href=\"https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-functions/functions-develop-vs?WT.mc_id=dotnet-blog-jasmineg\"></a></span> or the <a href=\"https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-functions/functions-run-local?WT.mc_id=dotnet-blog-jasmineg\"> </a>. You can create, debug, test, and deploy your function app all from the comfort of your own computer without even needing an Azure Subscription. You can test HTTP triggered functions locally with a tool like <span><a href=\"https://ngrok.com/\">ngrok</a></span>.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://msdnshared.blob.core.windows.net/media/2018/10/localdevfunctions.png\"><img src=\"https://msdnshared.blob.core.windows.net/media/2018/10/localdevfunctions-e1539638550541.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-19625 size-full\" width=\"800\" height=\"518\" /></a></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center\"><em>Local development of HTTP triggered function in Visual Studio</em></p>\n<p>Out of all of Azure’s storage account offerings, blob storage is suited for serving and storing unstructured data objects like textual files, including the markdown representation of the release notes. The blob storage structure is similar to common file systems where objects, named blobs, are organized and stored in containers. This way, the release notes have a dedicated location inside a “releases” container. You can manage a storage account on your computer with the Azure Storage Explorer.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center\"><em><a href=\"https://msdnshared.blob.core.windows.net/media/2018/10/storagexplorerblob1.png\"><img src=\"https://msdnshared.blob.core.windows.net/media/2018/10/storagexplorerblob1-1024x488.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"alignnone wp-image-19645 size-large\" width=\"879\" height=\"419\" /></a></em></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center\"><em>Release notes blobs in the releases container in Azure Storage Explorer</em></p>\n<p>The release function uses the Azure Storage API to create a file and append text and links to a file.

Over to Brian:</em></p>\n<p>Hello everyone! This summer I interned in the .NET team, working on <a href=\"https://www.microsoft.com/net/apps/machinelearning-ai/ml-dotnet\" rel=\"nofollow\">ML.NET</a>, an open-source machine learning platform which enables .NET developers to build and use machine learning models in their .NET applications. The ML.NET 0.6 release just shipped and you can <a href=\"https://www.microsoft.com/net/learn/machinelearning-ai/ml-dotnet-get-started-tutorial\">try it out today</a>.</p>\n<p>At the start of my internship, ML.NET code was already relying on vectorization for performance, using a native code library. This was an opportunity to reimplement an existing codebase in managed code, using .NET Hardware Intrinsics for vectorization, and compare results.</p>\n<h2>What is vectorization, and what are SIMD, SSE, and AVX?</h2>\n<p>Vectorization is a name used for applying the same operation to multiple elements of an array simultaneously. On the x86/x64 platform, vectorization can be achieved by using Single Instruction Multiple Data (SIMD) CPU instructions to operate on array-like objects.</p>\n<p>SSE (Streaming SIMD Extensions) and AVX (Advanced Vector Extensions) are the names for SIMD instruction set extensions to the x86 architecture. SSE has been available for a long time: the CoreCLR underlying .NET Core requires x86 platforms support at least the SSE2 instruction set. AVX is an extension to SSE that is now broadly available. Its key advantage is that it can handle 8 consecutive 32-bit elements in memory in one instruction, twice as much as SSE can.</p>\n<p>.NET Core 3.0 will expose SIMD instructions as API&#8217;s that are available to managed code directly, making it unnecessary to use native code to access them.</p>\n<p>ARM based CPU&#8217;s do offer a similar range of intrinsics but they are not yet supported on .NET Core (although work is<span> </span><a href=\"https://github.com/dotnet/corefx/issues/26179\">in progress</a>). Therefore, it is necessary to use software fallback code paths for the case when neither AVX nor SSE are available. The JIT makes it possible to do this fallback in a very efficient way. When .NET Core does expose ARM intrinsics, the code could exploit them at which point the software fallback would rarely if ever be needed.</p>\n<h2>Project goals</h2>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Increase ML.NET platform reach</strong><span> </span>(x86, x64, ARM32, ARM64, etc.) by creating a single managed assembly with software fallbacks</li>\n<li><strong>Increase ML.NET performance</strong><span> </span>by using AVX instructions where available</li>\n<li><strong>Validate .NET Hardware Intrinsics API</strong><span> </span>and demonstrate performance is comparable to native code</li>\n</ol>\n<p>I could have achieved the second goal by simply updating the native code to use AVX instructions, but by moving to managed code at the same time I could eliminate the need to build and ship a separate binary for each target architecture &#8211; it&#8217;s also usually easier to maintain managed code.</p>\n<p>I was able to achieve all these goals.</p>\n<h2>Challenges</h2>\n<p>It was necessary to first familiarize myself with C# and .NET, and then my work included:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>use<span> </span><code>Span&lt;T&gt;</code><span> </span>in the base-layer implementation of CPU math operations in C#. If you&#8217;re unfamiliar with<span> </span><code>Span&lt;T&gt;</code>, see this great MSDN magazine article<span> </span><a href=\"https://msdn.microsoft.com/magazine/mt814808.aspx\" rel=\"nofollow\">C# &#8211; All About Span: Exploring a New .NET Mainstay</a><span> </span>and also<span> </span><a href=\"https://docs.microsoft.com/dotnet/api/system.span-1\" rel=\"nofollow\">the documentation</a>.</li>\n<li>enable switching between AVX, SSE, and software implementations depending on availability.</li>\n<li>correctly handle pointers in the managed code, and remove alignment assumptions made by some of the existing code</li>\n<li>use multitargeting to allow ML.NET continued to function on platforms that don&#8217;t have .NET Hardware Intrinsics APIs.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Multi-targeting</h2>\n<p>.NET Hardware Intrinsics will ship in .NET Core 3.0, which is currently in development. ML.NET also needs to run on .NET Standard 2.0 compliant platforms &#8211; such as .NET Framework 4.7.2 and .NET Core 2.1. In order to support both I chose to use<span> </span><a href=\"https://docs.microsoft.com/dotnet/core/porting/project-structure#replace-existing-projects-with-a-multi-targeted-net-core-project\" rel=\"nofollow\">multitargeting</a><span> </span>to create a single<span> </span><code>.csproj</code><span> </span>file that targets both .NET Standard 2.0 and .NET Core 3.0.</p>\n<ol>\n<li>On<span> </span><strong>.NET Standard 2.0</strong>, the system will use the original native implementation with SSE hardware intrinsics</li>\n<li>On<span> </span><strong>.NET Core 3.0</strong>, the system will use the new managed implementation with AVX hardware intrinsics.</li>\n</ol>\n<h2>As the code was originally</h2>\n<p>In the original code, every trainer, learner, and transform used in machine learning ultimately called a<span> </span><code>SseUtils</code><span> </span>wrapper method that performs a CPU math operation on input arrays, such as</p>\n<ul>\n<li><code>MatMulDense</code>, which takes the matrix multiplication of two dense arrays interpreted as matrices, and</li>\n<li><code>SdcaL1UpdateSparse</code>, which performs the update step of the stochastic dual coordinate ascent for sparse arrays.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>These wrapper methods assumed a preference for SSE instructions, and called a corresponding method in another class<span> </span><code>Thunk</code>, which serves as the interface between managed and native code and contains methods that directly invoke their native equivalents. These native methods in<span> </span><code>.cpp</code><span> </span>files in turn implemented the CPU math operations with loops containing SSE hardware intrinsics.</p>\n<h2>Breaking out a managed code-path</h2>\n<p>To this code I added a new independent code path for CPU math operations that becomes active on .NET Core 3.0, and by keeping the original code path running on .NET Standard 2.0. All previous call sites of<span> </span><code>SseUtils</code>methods now called<span> </span><code>CpuMathUtils</code><span> </span>methods of the same name instead, keeping the API signatures of CPU math operations the same.</p>\n<p><code>CpuMathUtils</code><span> </span>is a new partial class that contains two definitions for each public API representing CPU math operation, one of which is compiled only on .NET Standard 2.0 while the other, only on .NET Core 3.0. This conditional compilation feature creates two independent code paths for<span> </span><code>CpuMathUtils</code><span> </span>methods. Those function definitions compiled on .NET Standard 2.0 call their<span> </span><code>SseUtils</code><span> </span>counterparts directly, which essentially follow the original native code path.</p>\n<h2>Writing code with software fallback</h2>\n<p>On the other hand, the other function definitions compiled on .NET Core 3.0 switch to one of three implementations of the same CPU math operation, based on availability at runtime:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>an<span> </span><code>AvxIntrinsics</code><span> </span>method which implements the operation with loops containing AVX hardware intrinsics,</li>\n<li>a<span> </span><code>SseIntrinsics</code><span> </span>method which implements the operation with loops containing SSE hardware intrinsics, and</li>\n<li>a software fallback in case neither AVX nor SSE is supported.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>You will commonly see this pattern whenever code uses .NET Hardware Intrinsics &#8211; for example, this is what the code looks like for adding a scalar to a vector:</p>\n<script src=\"https://gist.github.com/terrajobst/3f7ef692fafbf7c06ed8cc728f6b2937.js\"></script>\n<p>If AVX is supported, it is preferred, otherwise SSE is used if available, otherwise the software fallback path. At runtime, the JIT will actually generate code for only one of these three blocks, as appropriate for the platform it finds itself on.</p>\n<p>To give you an idea, here what the AVX implementation looks like that&#8217;s called by the method above:</p>\n<script src=\"https://gist.github.com/terrajobst/d40a13e40516977fb67d326b948df82a.js\"></script>\n<p>You will notice that it operates on<span> </span><code>float</code>s in groups of 8 using AVX, then any group of 4 using SSE, and finally a software loop for any that remain. (There are potentially more efficient ways to do this, which I won&#8217;t discuss here &#8211; there will be future blog posts dedicated to .NET Hardware Intrinsics.)</p>\n<p>You can see all my code<span> </span><a href=\"https://github.com/dotnet/machinelearning/tree/master/src/Microsoft.ML.CpuMath\">on the dotnet/machinelearning</a><span> </span>repository.</p>\n<p>Since the<span> </span><code>AvxIntrinsics</code><span> </span>and<span> </span><code>SseIntrinsics</code><span> </span>methods in managed code directly implement the CPU math operations analogous to the native methods originally in<span> </span><code>.cpp</code><span> </span>files, the code change not only removes native dependencies but also simplifies the levels of abstraction between public APIs and base-layer hardware intrinsics.</p>\n<p>After making this replacement I was able to use ML.NET to perform tasks such as train models with stochastic dual coordinate ascent, conduct hyperparameter tuning, and perform cross validation, on a<span> </span><strong>Raspberry Pi</strong>, when previously ML.NET required an x86 CPU.</p>\n<p>Here&#8217;s what the architecture looks like now (<strong>Figure 1</strong>):</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://msdnshared.blob.core.windows.net/media/2018/09/ml_01.png\"><img src=\"https://msdnshared.blob.core.windows.net/media/2018/09/ml_01.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"1908\" height=\"1208\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-19385\" /></a></p>\n<h2>Performance improvements</h2>\n<p>So what difference did this make to performance?</p>\n<p>I wrote tests using<span> </span><a href=\"https://benchmarkdotnet.org/index.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">Benchmark.NET</a><span> </span>to gather measurements.</p>\n<p>First, I disabled the AVX code paths in order to fairly compare the native and managed implementations while both were using the same SSE instructions. As Figure 2 shows, the performance is<span> </span><strong>closely comparable</strong>: on the large vectors the tests operate on, the overhead added by managed code is not significant.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://msdnshared.blob.core.windows.net/media/2018/09/ml_02.png\"><img src=\"https://msdnshared.blob.core.windows.net/media/2018/09/ml_02.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"1916\" height=\"1150\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-19395\" /></a></p>\n<p><strong>Figure 2</strong></p>\n<p>Second, I enabled AVX support. Figure 3 shows that the average performance gain in microbenchmarks was about<span> </span><strong>20%</strong><span> </span>over SSE alone.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://msdnshared.blob.core.windows.net/media/2018/09/ml_03.png\"><img src=\"https://msdnshared.blob.core.windows.net/media/2018/09/ml_03.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"1916\" height=\"1150\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-19405\" /></a></p>\n<p><strong>Figure 3</strong></p>\n<p>Taking both together &#8212; the upgrade from the SSE implementation in native code to the AVX implementation in managed code &#8212; I measured an<span> </span><strong>18%</strong><span> </span>improvement in the microbenchmarks. Some operations were up to 42% faster, while some others involving sparse inputs have potential for further optimization.</p>\n<p>What ultimately matters of course is the performance for real scenarios. On .NET Core 3.0, training models of K-means clustering and logistic regression got faster by about<span> </span><strong>14%</strong><span> </span>(Figure 4).</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://msdnshared.blob.core.windows.net/media/2018/09/ml_04.png\"><img src=\"https://msdnshared.blob.core.windows.net/media/2018/09/ml_04.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"2060\" height=\"778\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-19415\" /></a></p>\n<p><strong>Figure 4</strong></p>\n<h2>In closing</h2>\n<p>My summer internship experience with the .NET team has been rewarding and inspiring for me. My manager Dan and my mentors Santi and Eric gave me an opportunity to go hands-on with a real shipping project.

Oh My!","ContentEn":"<p>Last week, we posted the second blog of our <a href=\"https://blogs.bing.com/webmaster/october-2018/bingbot-Series-Optimizing-Crawl-Frequency\">bingbot Series: Optimizing Crawl Frequency</a>.</p>\n\n<p>Today is Halloween and like every day, our crawler (also known as a \"spider\") is wandering outside, browsing the world wide web, following links, seeking to efficiently discover, index and refresh the best web content for our Bing users.<br><img alt=\"bingbot, bings crawler\" src=\"https://blogs.bing.com/BingBlogs/media/WebmasterBlog/bingbot-crawl-halloween.png\"><br>\n&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Occasionally, bingbot encounters websites relying on JavaScript to render their content. Some of these sites link to many JavaScript files that need to be downloaded from the web server. In this setup, instead of making only one HTTP request per page, bingbot has to do several requests. Some some sites are spider traps, with dozens of HTTP calls required to render each page! Yikes. That's not optimal, now is it?&nbsp;<br><br>\nAs we shared last week at SMX East, <a href=\"https://www.slideshare.net/SearchMarketingExpo/understanding-crawling-and-indexing-by-frederic-dubut\">bingbot is generally able to render JavaScript.</a> However, bingbot does not necessarily support all the same JavaScript frameworks that are supported in the latest version of your <a href=\"https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/microsoft-edge\">favorite modern browser</a>. Like other search engine crawlers, it is difficult for bingbot to process JavaScript at scale on every page of every website, while minimizing the number of HTTP requests at the same time.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Therefore, in order to increase the predictability of crawling and indexing by Bing, we recommend dynamic rendering as a great alternative for websites relying heavily on JavaScript. Dynamic rendering is about detecting user agent and rendering content differently for humans and search engine crawlers. We encourage detecting our <a href=\"https://www.bing.com/webmaster/help/which-crawlers-does-bing-use-8c184ec0\">bingbot user agent</a>, prerendering the content on the server side and outputting static HTML for such sites, <strong>helping us minimize the number of HTTP requests and ensure we get the best and most complete version of your web pages every time bingbot visits your site.</strong></p>\n\n<h2>Is using JavaScript for Dynamic Rendering considered Cloaking?</h2>\n\n<p>When it comes to rendering content specifically for search engine crawlers, we inevitably get asked whether this is considered cloaking... and there is nothing scarier for the SEO community than getting penalized for cloaking, even during Halloween! The good news is that as long as you make a good faith effort to return the same content to all visitors, with the only difference being the content is rendered on the server for bots and on the client for real users, this is acceptable and not considered cloaking.</p>\n\n<p>So if your site relies a lot of JavaScript and you want to improve your crawling and indexing on Bing, look into dynamic rendering: you will certainly benefit immensely, receiving only treats and no tricks!</p>\n\n<p>Happy Halloween!<br><br>\nFabrice Canel and Fr&eacute;d&eacute;ric Dubut<br>\nProgram Managers</p>\n\n<p>Microsoft - Bing</p>","Link":"https://blogs.bing.com/webmaster/october-2018/bingbot-Series-JavaScript,-Dynamic-Rendering,-and-Cloaking-Oh-My","Categories":"BlogRss","IsPublishMP":false,"Thumbnail":"","Title":null,"AuthorName":"Bing Team","Author":null,"Comments":null,"ViewNunmber":0,"Content":null,"Keywords":"Bing blogs","Summary":null,"Id":"dcfc2118-0e30-47f7-afaf-73f5ca1c935f","CreatedTime":"2018-11-01T07:30:45+08:00","UpdatedTime":"2018-11-05T14:09:46.0961277+08:00","Status":0},{"TitleEn":"New to Microsoft 365 in October—tools to create impactful content and help transition to the cloud","ContentEn":"<p>This&nbsp;month, we&nbsp;released new features in Microsoft 365 that help teams enhance the look and feel of their content with ease, plus new tools and resources to help you transition to the cloud.</p>\n<p>Here&rsquo;s a look at what&rsquo;s new in October.</p>\n<h3>Create content that stands out</h3>\n<p>We&rsquo;re excited to introduce new capabilities&nbsp;that help enhance the visual look and feel and overall impact of your documents and presentations.</p>\n<p><strong>Bring your content to life with Embedded 3D Animations</strong>&mdash;Earlier this month, <a href=\"https://blogs.windows.com/windowsexperience/2018/10/02/find-out-whats-new-in-windows-and-office-in-october/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">we announced</a> that you will be able to insert Embedded 3D Animations in Word and PowerPoint&nbsp;to help easily illustrate more complex ideas&nbsp;in your presentations using 3D.
